       Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!
When I first found myself on the road
I was taught by a certain troll
By the sea and across the lands
With a calming drinking hand
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
        Easily raised! Grappa grappa hey!
Deutschland lager, über alles!
If walk away to left me feeling bleak
If ango bitters we'll make it cheers!
        </p>
        <p class="verse">
        Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
Hey hey hey!
I will lead this way, until the fall of my final time!           
        </p>

        Weary traveler hydrated
Was the of bottled kind?
Our plan is scattered here
And the plan is loud and clear!
Everyone in full swing
Wraths of kiln will attend to sing
No one cares what tomorrow brings
And the sauna burns loud again!
Hey hey hey!
I'm a man with a plan!
The plan is to booze as much as I can!
Hey hey hey!
I will lead this way, until the fall of my final time!
